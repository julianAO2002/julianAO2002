<h1 align="center">Hi there! I'm Julian 👋</h1>

### 💻 About Me

I'm currently studying for a **Bachelor’s Degree in Information Systems**, with a deep interest in programming, system design, and technical problem-solving. I like to go beyond the surface—understanding how and why things work.

I approach problems like puzzles. Whether it's academic simulations (like airports or toll booths) or symbolic analyses with a psychological lens, I enjoy finding patterns, connections, and meaningful solutions.
